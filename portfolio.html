    <h1>   Python Project: "Space Vanquishers"</h1>
    <img src="Project.PNG" height="250"> <p> We made a moveable spaceship that shoots lazers.
		You get points for hitting enemies and minus points for hitting satellites or letting enemies touch or pass by you.</p>

    <h1>   Python Project: "Shark Time"</h1>
    <img src="sharktime.jpeg" height="250"> <p> We made a game in which the user controls a shark that moves through a maze avoiding the walls trying to eat fish that are randomly placed within the maze.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>   Python Project: "Chrome Dino"</h1>
    <img src="bgpic.gif" height="250"> <p> Our idea was to make a game like Chrome's T-rex game in which the player controls a little dinosaur that needs to jump over objects coming at him or her at increasing speeds. It didn't end up working properly but was still pretty cool.</p>
